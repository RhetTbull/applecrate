# PyApp Runner -- Very simple CI for building/packaging python project via PyApp and AppleCrate
# This script is used to build and copy the PyApp executable from a remote server.
# It also packages the executable with applecrate, signs it, and copies it back to the local machine.

# See https://ofek.dev/pyapp/latest/how-to/ for more information on PyApp.
# The remote server must have PYAPP defined in the ~/.zshenv file
# to point to the install location of pyapp.
# echo 'export PYAPP="/Users/johndoe/code/pyapp-latest"' >> ~/.zshenv
# For code signing to work via ssh, you must first run this one time on the machine via GUI
# See https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/712005 for more information on signing via ssh
# You must also have the following environment variables set in the ~/.zshenv of the remote server:
# export DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION="Developer ID Application: John Doe (XXXXXXXX)"
# export KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD="password"
# export CODE_DIR="/Users/johndoe/code" # the directory where the code is located
# This script assumes the code for the project is located in the directory $CODE_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME
# and that the project is configured for AppleCrate via the applecrate.toml file in the project directory.

# Usage: pyapp-runner.sh SERVER PROJECT_NAME PROJECT_VERSION
# SERVER is the nick name of the remote server and will be combined with $PYAPP_SERVER_ to get the actual server name
# In my case, I have the following values for the server in my ~/.zshrc file:
# export PYAPP_SERVER_INTEL="address of Intel Mac"
# export PYAPP_SERVER_ARM="address of Apple Silicon Mac"

# Check that all 3 arguments are provided
